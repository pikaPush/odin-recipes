  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Italian lasagna is a classic and hearty dish made with layers of wide pasta sheets, rich meat sauce, creamy or
    ricotta cheese, and a generous topping of melted mozzarella and Parmesan. Traditionally baked until
    golden and bubbling, lasagna is known for its comforting, savory flavor and satisfying texture. The meat sauce,
    often made with ground beef or pork simmered in tomatoes, garlic, onions, and herbs, brings depth to every bite.
    Each layer melds together beautifully, making lasagna a beloved staple of Italian cuisine and a favorite at family
    gatherings and special occasions.</p>
