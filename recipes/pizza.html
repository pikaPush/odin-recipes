  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Pizza is a beloved Italian dish that has become a global favorite, known for its irresistible combination of flavors
    and textures. It typically features a thin, crispy or soft crust topped with a rich tomato sauce, melted mozzarella
    cheese, and a variety of toppings such as pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, olives, or fresh basil. Baked in a hot
    oven until the cheese is bubbly and golden, pizza offers a perfect balance of savory, cheesy, and slightly tangy
    taste. Whether enjoyed as a quick snack, a casual meal, or a party favorite, pizza brings people together with its
    comforting and customizable appeal.
